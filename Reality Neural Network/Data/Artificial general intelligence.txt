Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is the ability of an intelligent agent to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can.
It is a primary goal of some artificial intelligence research and a common topic in science fiction and futures studies. AGI is also called strong AI, full AI, or general intelligent action, although some academic sources reserve the term "strong AI" for computer programs that experience sentience or consciousness.Strong AI contrasts with weak AI (or narrow AI), which is not intended to have general cognitive abilities; rather, weak AI is any program that is designed to solve exactly one problem. (Academic sources reserve "weak AI" for programs that do not experience consciousness or do not have a mind in the same sense people do.) 
A 2020 survey identified 72 active AGI R&D projects spread across 37 countries.


== Characteristics ==

Various criteria for intelligence have been proposed (most famously the Turing test) but to date, there is no definition that satisfies everyone.


=== Intelligence traits ===
However, there is wide agreement among artificial intelligence researchers that intelligence is required to do the following:
reason, use strategy, solve puzzles, and make judgments under uncertainty;
represent knowledge, including common sense knowledge;
plan;
learn;
communicate in natural language;and integrate all these skills towards common goals. Other important capabilities include:

input as the ability to sense (e.g. see, hear, etc.), and
output as the ability to act (e.g. move and manipulate objects, change own location to explore, etc.)in this world where intelligent behaviour is to be observed. This would include an ability to detect and respond to hazard.
